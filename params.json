This\r\nclass is intended for undergraduate students from relevant disciplines\r\n(e.g., geography, geology, environmental science and social sciences)\r\nwho are interested in analysis of spatial data. Students will be\r\nencouraged to engage this course with their thesis/dissertation topics\r\nand research interests.\r\n\r\nThis course will introduce fundamental concepts and commonly used\r\nmethods in quantitative analysis of spatial data. Specifically, this\r\ncourse includes:\r\n\r\n-   Representation of spatial data (fundamentals in spatial databases)\r\n\r\n-   Concepts in spatial analysis and spatial statistics\r\n\r\n-   Spatial analysis methods for various types of spatial data (spatial\r\n    points, networks, and areal/lattice data), including\r\n    overlay/suitability analysis, spatial statistical methods such as\r\n    exploratory spatial data analysis (e.g., Moran’s I), spatial\r\n    interpolation (e.g. kriging) and spatial regression.\r\n\r\nA lab/discussion session (approximately *2* hours) follows the lecture for\r\nstudents to gain hands-on experiences on real-world datasets by using\r\nmultiple software tools. The software packages utilized in lab sessions\r\ninclude *ArcGIS*, *Open GeoDa*, *R* or *Matlab*. Students with expertise or\r\ninterest in the statistical package *R* or *Matlab* are encouraged to use\r\nthem but it is not required.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nPrerequisites of this course includes an understanding of basic algebra,\r\ngeneral statistics (e.g., knowledge of statistical significance) and\r\nmatrix manipulations, and working knowledge of at least one GIS software\r\npackages, e.g. ArcGIS, which could be fulfilled with <span>*GIST\r\n3300/5300*</span>. However, students from different disciplines are\r\nwelcome, please contact the instructor should there any question about\r\nthe prerequisites.\r\n\r\n## Learning outcomes\r\n\r\nAfter completing this course, the of this class are expected to learn\r\nhow to:\r\n\r\n-   formulate real-world problems in the context of geographic\r\n    information systems and spatial analysis\r\n\r\n-   apply appropriate spatial analytical methods to solve the problems\r\n\r\n-   utilize mainstream software tools (commercial or open-source) to\r\n    solve spatial problems\r\n\r\n-   communicate results of spatial analysis in the forms of writing and\r\n    presentation\r\n\r\n## Readings\r\n\r\nThe main course text is:\r\n\r\n-   O’Sullivan, David and David J. Unwin (2010), *Geographic Information\r\n    Analysis, 2nd Edition*, John Wily & Sons. The first edition of this\r\n    book works in the most cases as well.\r\n\r\nThe following books will be helpful for some topics of this class.\r\nAdditional readings and handouts ill be suggested as the class\r\nprogresses.\r\n\r\n-   de Smith, Michael J., Paul A. Longley and Michael F. Goodchild\r\n    (2013), *Geospatial Analysis: A Comprehensive Guide to Principles,\r\n    Techniques and Software Tools, 4th Edition*. Available in both print\r\n    and web () version at <http://www.spatialanalysisonline.com>\r\n\r\n-   Fotheringham, A.S., Brundson, C., and M. Charlton (2003),\r\n    *Geographically Weighted Regression*, John Wiley & Sons.\r\n\r\nFor the lab assignments, you have different options of software tools to\r\nchoose from. If using ArcGIS, you might find the following book helpful:\r\n\r\n-   Allen, David W. (2011), *GIS Tutorial 2, Spatial Analysis Workbook\r\n    for ArcGIS 10*, Esri Press.\r\n\r\n-   Mitchell, A. (2009), *The ESRI Guide to GIS Analysis, vol. 2:\r\n    spatial measurements and statistics*, ESRI Press.\r\n\r\nif using R:\r\n\r\n-   Bivand Roger S., Pebesma, Edzer J., and Gómez-Rubio, Virgilio\r\n    (2008), *Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R*, Springer.\r\n\r\nif using Matlab:\r\n\r\n-   Martinez, W.L. and Martinez, A.R. (2007), *Computational Statistics\r\n    Handbook with MATLAB, 2nd Edition*, Taylor & Francis – Chapman\r\n    & Hall/CRC.\r\n\r\n## Assessment\r\n\r\nThere are two written exams in this course (a midterm and a final), lab\r\nexercises, and a final project that includes a project proposal and\r\nfinal report. The exams are used to assess your understanding of the\r\nbasic concepts discussed in the lecture, and the format of the exams\r\nwill consist of a combination of multiple choice, short answer and short\r\nessay questions.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the final project is to provide experiences for students\r\nto apply the methods and tools learned from this class to real-world\r\nspatial problems. Topics of the final project could be related to the\r\nspatial aspect of a thesis or another course work. The proposal\r\nassociated with the final project should include a clear description of the\r\nproposed problems with appropriate background literatures justifying the\r\nmotivation, description of the collected data sources, and methodology\r\nadopted to address the problem. When the project proposal is due (Nov.3rd),\r\nstudents are expected to have collected the necessary data at hand. The\r\nfinal project will require a presentation of about 6-10 mins (*PechaKucha\r\nstyle*: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha>), and a final project\r\nreport.  Students are encouraged to start thinking of project ideas early\r\nin the semester, and communicate them with the instructor and the TA for\r\nfeedbacks and comments.\r\n\r\n## Grading\r\n\r\nEach exam, lab exercise and final project is worth $100$ points, and the\r\nfinal points will be a combination of these three elements according to\r\nthe following weights:\r\n\r\n-   two written exams: 30% (each 15%)\r\n\r\n-   six (out of nine) lab exercises: 40% (each $\\sim 6.6\\%$)\r\n\r\n-   final project proposal (5%), presentation (10%) and paper (15%) :\r\n    30%\r\n\r\nTo ensure a specific grade in this course you must meet the following\r\nminimum requirements: A - 90%, B - 80%, C - 70%, D - 60%.\r\n\r\n## University policy\r\n\r\n-   Academic honesty (OP 34.12):\r\n    <http://www.depts.ttu.edu/opmanual/OP34.12.pdf>\r\n\r\n-   Students with disabilities (OP 34.22):\r\n    <http://www.depts.ttu.edu/opmanual/OP34.22.pdf>\r\n\r\n-   Students absence for observance of a religious holy day (OP 34.19):\r\n    <http://www.depts.ttu.edu/opmanual/OP34.19.pdf>\r\n\r\n",
