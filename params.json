However,\r\nstudents from different disciplines are welcome, please contact the\r\ninstructor should there any question about the prerequisites.\r\n\r\n## Course description\r\n\r\nWith the continuing advances of technological development, spatial data\r\nhave been easily and increasingly available in the past decades and\r\nbecoming important information sources in daily decision makings. This\r\nclass is intended for students (undergraduate and graduate students)\r\nfrom relevant disciplines (e.g., geography, geology, environmental\r\nscience and social sciences) who are interested in analysis of spatial\r\ndata. Students will be encouraged to engage this course with their\r\nthesis/dissertation topics and research interests.\r\n\r\nThis course will introduce fundamental concepts and commonly used\r\nmethods in quantitative analysis of spatial data. Specifically, this\r\ncourse includes:\r\n\r\n-   Representation of spatial data (fundamentals in spatial databases)\r\n\r\n-   Concepts in spatial analysis and spatial statistics\r\n\r\n-   Spatial analysis methods for various types of spatial data (spatial\r\n    points, networks, and areal/lattice data), including\r\n    overlay/suitability analysis, spatial statistical methods such as\r\n    exploratory spatial data analysis (e.g., Moran’s I), spatial\r\n    interpolation (e.g. kriging) and spatial regression.\r\n\r\nA lab/discussion session (approximately *2* hours) follows the lecture\r\nfor students to gain hands-on experiences on real-world datasets by\r\nusing multiple software tools. The software packages utilized in lab\r\nsessions include ArcGIS, Open GeoDa, R or Matlab. Students ( in\r\nparticular) with expertise or interest in the statistical package R or\r\nMatlab are encouraged to use them but it is not required.\r\n\r\n## Course Schedule\r\n|Week |Lecture Dates| Lecture Topics | Readings | Lab/Discussion Topics |\r\n|-----|-------------|----------------|----------|-----------------------|\r\n|1    |Aug 30, Sept 1 |Overview of the course; Introduction to spatial analysis| O'S & U ch.1   | Review of map projection and ArcGIS | \r\n|2    |Sept 6, 8  |Spatial data representation & operations: vector analysis| O'S & U ch.1 and 10   | |\r\n|3    |Sept 13, 15  |Spatial data representation & operations: vector analysis| O'S & U ch.1 and 10   | |\r\n|4    |Sept 20, 22 |Spatial data representation & operations: raster analysis | O'S & U ch.1 and 10   | |\r\n|5    |Sept 27, 29 |Spatial data representation & operations: raster analysis| O'S & U ch.1 and 10   | |\r\n|6    |Oct 4,6 |Statistics review; pitfalls and potential of spatial data | O'S & U ch.2, 3 and Appendix A-B  | |\r\n|7    | Oct 11, 13 |Point pattern analysis| O'S & U ch.4 and 5  | |\r\n|8    | Oct 18, 20 |Student project discussion; midterm|  | |\r\n|9    | Oct 25, 27 |Spatial statistics of areal objects & exploratory analysis| O'S &U ch.7 | |\r\n|10   | Nov 1,3  |Spatial statistics of areal objects & exploratory analysis| O'S &U ch.7 | |\r\n|11   | Nov 8, 10  |Spatial regression| handouts  | |\r\n|12   | Nov 15,17 |Spatial regression| handouts | |\r\n|13   | Nov 22, thanksgiving  |Spatial interpolation| O'S&U ch.8 and 9 | |\r\n|14   | Nov 29, Dec 1 |Spatial interpolation| O'S&U ch.8 and 9 | |\r\n|15   | Dec 6 | Review|  | |\r\n|16   | Dec 10 1:30-4:00pm  | Final |  | |\r\n\r\n## Learning outcomes\r\n\r\nAfter completing this course, the **undergraduate** of this class are expected to learn\r\nhow to:\r\n\r\n-   formulate real-world problems in the context of geographic\r\n    information systems and spatial analysis\r\n\r\n-   apply appropriate spatial analytical methods to solve the problems\r\n\r\n-   utilize mainstream software tools (commercial or open-source) to\r\n    solve spatial problems\r\n\r\n-   communicate results of spatial analysis in the forms of writing and\r\n    presentation\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the **graduate** students of this class are expected to learn\r\n\r\n-   the concept of spatial uncertainty\r\n\r\n-   commonly used spatial statistical methods work and connect them to\r\n    the thesis and dissertation work\r\n\r\n-   evaluation and assessment of the results of alternative methods\r\n\r\n\r\n## Readings\r\n\r\nThe main course text is:\r\n\r\n-   O’Sullivan, David and David J. Unwin (2010), *Geographic Information\r\n    Analysis, 2nd Edition*, John Wily & Sons. The first edition of this\r\n    book works in the most cases as well.\r\n\r\nThe following books will be helpful for some topics of this class.\r\nAdditional readings and handouts ill be suggested as the class\r\nprogresses.\r\n\r\n-   de Smith, Michael J., Paul A. Longley and Michael F. Goodchild\r\n    (2013), *Geospatial Analysis: A Comprehensive Guide to Principles,\r\n    Techniques and Software Tools, 4th Edition*. Available in both print\r\n    and web () version at <http://www.spatialanalysisonline.com>\r\n\r\n-   Fotheringham, A.S., Brundson, C., and M. Charlton (2003),\r\n    *Geographically Weighted Regression*, John Wiley & Sons.\r\n\r\nFor the lab assignments, you have different options of software tools to\r\nchoose from. If using ArcGIS, you might find the following book helpful:\r\n\r\n-   Allen, David W. (2011), *GIS Tutorial 2, Spatial Analysis Workbook\r\n    for ArcGIS 10*, Esri Press.\r\n\r\n-   Mitchell, A.

(2007), *Computational Statistics\r\n    Handbook with MATLAB, 2nd Edition*, Taylor & Francis – Chapman\r\n    & Hall/CRC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Assessment\r\n\r\nThere are two written exams in this course (a midterm and a final), lab\r\nexercises, and a final project that includes a project proposal and final\r\nreport. **Graduate students** will have extra questions for the lab and the\r\nexams, and higher standard for the final project outcomes.  The exams are\r\nused to assess your understanding of the basic concepts discussed in the\r\nlecture, and the format of the exams will consist of a combination of\r\nmultiple choice, short answer and short essay questions. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the final project is to provide experiences for students to\r\napply the methods and tools learned from this class to real-world spatial\r\nproblems.  Topics of the final project could be related to the spatial\r\naspect of a thesis or another course work. The proposal associated with the\r\nfinal project should include a clear description of the proposed problems\r\nwith appropriate background literatures justifying the motivation,\r\ndescription of the collected data sources, and methodology adopted to\r\naddress the problem.  When the project proposal is due (Nov.3rd), students\r\nare expected to have collected the necessary data at hand. The final\r\nproject will require a presentation of about 6-10 mins [*PechaKucha\r\nstyle*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha), and a final project\r\nreport. Students are encouraged to start thinking of project ideas early in\r\nthe semester, and communicate them with the instructor and the TA for\r\nfeedbacks and comments.\r\n\r\n## Grading\r\n\r\nEach exam, lab exercise and final project is worth $100$ points, and the\r\nfinal points will be a combination of these three elements according to\r\nthe following weights:\r\n\r\n-   two written exams: 30% (each 15%)\r\n\r\n-   six (out of nine) lab exercises: 40% (each ~ 6.6%)\r\n\r\n-   final project proposal (5%), presentation (10%) and paper (15%) :\r\n    30%\r\n\r\nTo ensure a specific grade in this course you must meet the following\r\nminimum requirements: A - 90%, B - 80%, C - 70%, D - 60%.\r\n\r\n## University policy\r\n\r\n-   Academic honesty (OP 34.12):\r\n    <http://www.depts.ttu.edu/opmanual/OP34.12.pdf>\r\n\r\n-   Students with disabilities (OP 34.22):\r\n    <http://www.depts.ttu.edu/opmanual/OP34.22.pdf>\r\n\r\n-   Students absence for observance of a religious holy day (OP 34.19):\r\n    <http://www.depts.ttu.edu/opmanual/OP34.19.pdf>\r\n\r\n",
