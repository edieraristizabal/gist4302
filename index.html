<h2>
<a id="course-description" class="anchor" href="#course-description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course description</h2>

<p>With the continuing advances of technological development, spatial data
have been easily and increasingly available in the past decades and
becoming important information sources in daily decision makings. This
class is intended for undergraduate students from relevant disciplines
(e.g., geography, geology, environmental science and social sciences)
who are interested in analysis of spatial data. Students will be
encouraged to engage this course with their thesis/dissertation topics
and research interests.</p>

<p>This course will introduce fundamental concepts and commonly used
methods in quantitative analysis of spatial data. Specifically, this
course includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Representation of spatial data (fundamentals in spatial databases)</p></li>
<li><p>Concepts in spatial analysis and spatial statistics</p></li>
<li><p>Spatial analysis methods for various types of spatial data (spatial
points, networks, and areal/lattice data), including
overlay/suitability analysis, spatial statistical methods such as
exploratory spatial data analysis (e.g., Moran’s I), spatial
interpolation (e.g. kriging) and spatial regression.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A lab/discussion session (approximately <em>2</em> hours) follows the lecture for
students to gain hands-on experiences on real-world datasets by using
multiple software tools. The software packages utilized in lab sessions
include <em>ArcGIS</em>, <em>Open GeoDa</em>, <em>R</em> or <em>Matlab</em>. Students with expertise or
interest in the statistical package <em>R</em> or <em>Matlab</em> are encouraged to use
them but it is not required.</p>

<h2>
<a id="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Prerequisites of this course includes an understanding of basic algebra,
general statistics (e.g., knowledge of statistical significance) and
matrix manipulations, and working knowledge of at least one GIS software
packages, e.g. ArcGIS, which could be fulfilled with <em>GIST
3300/5300</em>. However, students from different disciplines are
welcome, please contact the instructor should there any question about
the prerequisites.</p>

<h2>
<a id="learning-outcomes" class="anchor" href="#learning-outcomes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Learning outcomes</h2>

<p>After completing this course, the of this class are expected to learn
how to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>formulate real-world problems in the context of geographic
information systems and spatial analysis</p></li>
<li><p>apply appropriate spatial analytical methods to solve the problems</p></li>
<li><p>utilize mainstream software tools (commercial or open-source) to
solve spatial problems</p></li>
<li><p>communicate results of spatial analysis in the forms of writing and
presentation</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="readings" class="anchor" href="#readings" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Readings</h2>

<h2>
<a id="assessment" class="anchor" href="#assessment" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assessment</h2>

<p>There are two written exams in this course (a midterm and a final), lab
exercises, and a final project that includes a project proposal and
final report. The exams are used to assess your understanding of the
basic concepts discussed in the lecture, and the format of the exams
will consist of a combination of multiple choice, short answer and short
essay questions.</p>

<p>The purpose of the final project is to provide experiences for students
to apply the methods and tools learned from this class to real-world
spatial problems. Topics of the final project could be related to the
spatial aspect of a thesis or another course work. The proposal
associated with the final project should include a clear description of the
proposed problems with appropriate background literatures justifying the
motivation, description of the collected data sources, and methodology
adopted to address the problem. When the project proposal is due (Nov.3rd),
students are expected to have collected the necessary data at hand. The
final project will require a presentation of about 6-10 mins (<em>PechaKucha
style</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha</a>), and a final project
report.  Students are encouraged to start thinking of project ideas early
in the semester, and communicate them with the instructor and the TA for
feedbacks and comments.</p>

<h2>
<a id="grading" class="anchor" href="#grading" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Grading</h2>

<p>Each exam, lab exercise and final project is worth $100$ points, and the
final points will be a combination of these three elements according to
the following weights:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>two written exams: 30% (each 15%)</p></li>
<li><p>six (out of nine) lab exercises: 40% (each $\sim 6.6\%$)</p></li>
<li><p>final project proposal (5%), presentation (10%) and paper (15%) :
30%</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure a specific grade in this course you must meet the following
minimum requirements: A - 90%, B - 80%, C - 70%, D - 60%.</p>
